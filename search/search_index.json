It's being used at a club championship event in Roderath (Germany). Side note: This event takes place at the exact venue where the very first European Championships were held. While all blocks are counting equally, the tests within each block have different factors, for example T1 results are multiplied by 0.85, while T7 scores are only multiplied by 0.4. Riders must ride at least one test from each block, and the best result from each block is used to calculate the final score. <!-- Note: This is only an excerpt, not the full file.

What is a Derived Result? \u00b6 In IceTest-NG, a \"Derived Result\" is any result that is automatically calculated from one or more results of the same competition. Derived Results (sometimes also referred to as \"Overall Ranking\" or \"Combination Ranking\") can be used to achieve the following: Merge results from different tests, for example provide a combined total ranking for two separate T7 classes Filter results, for example provide a ranking of a V5 class only for members of a certain club Combine results, for example calculate an overall score for riders who participated in a t\u00f6lt and a gaited class Adding Derived Results to an event \u00b6 Just like tests, Derived Results can be added either from an official test catalog (provided by FEIF or a national association) or from a custom XML file prepared by the user. In order to add a Derived Result, go to the Tests page and click the competition name in the bread crumb menu on the top of the list to open the Competition Setup popup. Go to the Derived Results tab. The left column shows the available Derived Results. Drag the desired Derived Result to the right column. Close the overlay to save your changes. See section XML Definitions for details on building your own custom Derived Results in XML. Working with Derived Results \u00b6 Once a Derived Result has been added to the competition, it will be listed on the Tests page. Unlike the regular tests, it will feature only a results (flag) icon. Derived Results are updated automatically. Every time a result is entered for a test that is counting towards a Dervied Result, the calculation will be updated both in IceTestNG and on the ticker website. If a competition makes use of age classes, Derived Results will feature separate rankings for both all age classes combined and every single age class.","title":"Overall Rankings"},{"location":"custom-rankings/#overall-rankings","text":"This document details how to use Derived Results aka Overall Rankings and how you can use pre-made ones or define your own in IceTest-NG.","title":"Overall Rankings"},{"location":"custom-rankings/#what-is-a-derived-result","text":"In IceTest-NG, a \"Derived Result\" is any result that is automatically calculated from one or more results of the same competition.

It allows officials (vets, ring masters, judges etc.) to conduct all checks mentioned in the FEIF Rules & Regulations to ensure the wellbeing of horses shown in competitions. The app will document all checks and transfer the findings back to the IceTest-NG database. This way, all information is stored in one place and can be accessed by the data center manager, the judges and the officials. Supported Checks \u00b6 Currently, the app can be used to document the following checks according to the FEIF Rules & Regulations: Arrival check (normally only used at the World Championships) Fit-to-compete check (G5.1) Equipment check / exit check (G5.1) Shoeing check (G6.5) Identification check (S8.12) Prerequisites \u00b6 The following prerequisites must be met to use the Equipment Check App: You need to have a user account in IceTest-NG with the role \"Judge\" assigned. You need to have a smartphone or tablet device running iOS or Android. The competition must be taking place in Denmark, Germany, or under direct responsibility of FEIF (for example the World Championships). Installation \u00b6 iPhone / iPad users can download the app from the App Store by visiting the following link: Equipment Check App for iOS . Android users can download the app from the Play Store here: Equipment Check App for Android . Sign up / Login \u00b6 When running the app for the first time, you will need to sign up with your email address. This email address must be the same as the one you are registered with as an official in IceTest-NG . If you are not sure which email address you are registered with, please contact the data center manager of the competition. After signing up, you will receive a confirmation email (check your spam folder in case you don't see the message in your inbox). Please click on the link in the email to confirm your account. After that, you can log in with your email address and password. Please note : Your login credentials for the Equipment Check App are separate from your IceTest-NG credentials. Both share the same email address, but have different password. Once you created your login credentials for the app, you can use them for all future logins on as many devices and competitions as needed. List of Competitions \u00b6 After logging in, you will see a list of current or upcoming competitions you are assigned to as an official. Tap the competition you want to work with to proceed. Please refer to the training section below to learn how to practice with the app before your first \"real\" competition. Conducting Checks \u00b6 Arrival \u00b6 This checks is usually done by a veterinarian as soon as the horse arrives at the competition grounds. This is a very minimal check to confirm the horse's identity, vaccination history, temperature logging records and very basic health information. The first step is to scan the horses's microchip to confirm the chip matches the information at the top of the screen. The veterinarian uses the drop-down option to indicate the outcome of the microchip scan. The veterinarian then enters the temperature, respirations, and pulse observations. The three check sliders are used to confirm the general health of the horse, the vaccination schedule and its record in the passport, and that a correct temperature log is present. In rare cases, the verterinarian can use the comment box to record any other observations. This, normally, would only happen if a horse is not accepted into the competition grounds. Finally, the veterinarian completes the arrival using the Accepted or Rejected button to capture the overall conclusion of the arrival process. Fit-to-Compete \u00b6 This check is usually done by a veterinarian after arrival of the horse at the competition grounds. The team can find a list of all starting combinations in the Fit to Compete test in the list of all the test phases at the competition. The list shows all starting combinations together with an indication of which have been checked. You may also use the search feature at the top of the screen to quickly find a combination based on the Starting Number, Rider, or Horse. After selecting the horse from the list of participating horses, its pulse, respiration rate, and temperature can be entered along with additional comments. In case any wounds are found, they can be documented as described in the Equipment Check section. Possible outcomes are \"Accepted\", \"Recheck\", and \"Rejected\". If a horse is accepted the status will change in IceTest from ENTERED to READY. If a horse is set for recheck it will appear in the Fit to Compete RECHECK list automatically. If a horse is rejected the status in IceTest will be set to CANCELLED. The competition office should be informed about any horses which are rejected so they may make sure the test entries and any charges related to the competition are handled correctly. Shoeing \u00b6 The shoeing check is sometimes done before the horse starts for the first time in the competition, but it can also be done at any time during the competition. After selecting the horse from the list of participating horses, a variety of items can be documented. This includes the length of all four toes, the thickness of the shoes, the presence of studs, cores, pads and rings. The official can also take pictures of the shoeing and add comments. Possible outcomes are \"Accepted\", \"Recheck\", and \"Rejected\". If a horse is selected for recheck it will automatically be placed in the list of shoeing rechecks. Findings of accepted or rejected are not passed along to IceTest. If a horse is removed from the competition entirely because of unacceptable shoeing, the competition office must get involved to make the necessary changes in IceTest. Equipment \u00b6 Equipment or exit checks are done right after the horse has left the track after the class. Both the equipment used and the horse itself are checked. The app will offer all start lists of the competition by mentioning its test code and phase (\"V1 PREL\", \"T3 AFIN\", and so on). A start list will show a random selection of horses to be checked, but you can flip the \"Show all?\" switch at the top to see all horses. In addition, you can filter the list by Starting Number, the name of the horse, or the rider in the search field. After selecting a horse combination the list, a variety of items can be documented. This includes details about the bit, the bridle, boots, and other protective equipment. There's also room for notes on the shoeing. If any injuries are found, they can be documented as well toward the bottom of the screen: Begin by selecting either the \"Mouth\" or \"Leg\" button. Locate the position of the wound by tapping on the corresponding area of the horse image. Fill in the details of the wound, including its type, size, and any other relevant information. You can also take a picture of the wound and add comments. Finally, select the \"Save\" button to store the wound information. The app will automatically calculate the total wound score based on the number of wounds and their severity. The official can finally select the outcome of the check: \"Accepted\" or \"Disqualified\". If there are no injuries, the official can push the \"Save Equipment\" button and go back to the start list right away. In the upper right corner, there are two round icons. The first one brings up any other injuries of the horse that have been documented during the same competition. The second one shows the results of a previous shoeing check from the same competition. This way, the official can compare the current check with previous ones. Identification \u00b6 The identification check is part of the Arrival , Fit to Compete and Equipment checks mentioned above. It's a simple check to verify the identity of the horse by microchip. The app shows the microchip number, FEIF-ID, and name of the selected horse. The official can check the microchip number with a microchip reader and compare the reading to the chip number shown in the app. Then, they can confirm/unconfirm the identity by selecting \"Success\" or \"Failure\" from the dropdown menu. Possible outcomes are \"Success\" and \"Failure\", and \"No Attempt\". Demo Account \u00b6 If you want to try out the app before your first competition, you can use the demo account. Please contact us at support@icetestng.com to get the login credentials. The demo account is a fully functional version of the app, but it does not store any data in the IceTest-NG database.

Typical use cases are signup systems that can send participant data to IceTest NG or Icelandic horse associations requesting results from IceTest NG. A wide range of further use cases is possible, and we encourage you to get in touch if you are interested in accessing the API. Base URL \u00b6 The base URL of the API is https://api.icetestng.com/index.cfm/v1 . The full URL of a request consists of the base URL and the appended resource and endpoint information, for example https://api.icetestng.com/index.cfm/v1/competition or https://api.icetestng.com/index.cfm/v1/test/list . The documentation on available resources and endpoints will also mention the HTTP verb required for different requests. Authentication \u00b6 All requests sent to the API need to provide a username and password according to the Basic Authentication scheme: an Authorization header starting with the word Basic followed by username:password in base64-encoded format. Authorization : Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA == :::note Usernames and passwords for use with the API are separate from login credentials for the IceTest NG application. Please contact us if you need a username/password for the API. ::: Most requests require an authorization token in addition to username and password. A token represents the permission given to a user to access a specific competition. A token can be retrieved via the API while creating a new competition, and will be sent as part of the payload when making requests. Payload \u00b6 Data that is sent to the API is expected to be in JSON format: ```jsx title=\"GET /competition\" showLineNumbers { \"competitionId\": \"9ffa0058-35bf-433a-9d4db9cbffd54e50\", \"token\": \"YTvJF7YUxPyXMt/W1w6YcA==\", \"sandbox\": true } ## Environments The API supports two environments , ** production ** and ** sandbox **.

Definition \u00b6 In IceTest NG, a \"Derived Result\" is any result that is automatically calculated from one or more results of the same competition. Derived Results (also being called \"Combination Rankings\" sometimes) can be used to achieve the following: merge results from different tests, for example provide a combined total ranking for two separate T7 classes filter results, for example provide a ranking of a V5 class only for members of a certain club combine results, for example calculate an overall score for riders who participated in a t\u00f6lt and a gaited class Adding Derived Results to an event \u00b6 Just like tests, Derived Results can be added either from an official test catalog (provided by FEIF or a national association) or from a custom XML file prepared by the user. In order to add a Derived Result, go to the Tests page and click the competition name in the bread crumb menu on the top of the list to open the Competition Setup popup. Go to the Derived Results tab. The left column shows the available Derived Results. Drag the desired Derived Result to the right column. Close the overlay to save your changes. See section XML description for details on building your own custom Derived Results in XML. Working with Derived Results \u00b6 Once a Derived Result has been added to the competition, it will be listed on the Tests page. Unlike the regular tests, it will feature only a results (flag) icon. Derived Results are updated automatically. Every time a result is entered for a test that is counting towards a Dervied Result, the calculation will be updated both in IceTestNG and on the ticker website. If a competition makes use of age classes, Derived Results will feature separate rankings for both all age classes combined and every single age class. Defining custom Derived Results \u00b6 Users can create their own Derived Results as part of an XML file that can be imported via the Import Local Tests page. The general structure of such a file is as follows: ```jsx title=\"davos2023.xml\" LOCAL 2019 1 CI Icelandic Combination STA T\u00f6lt one 1 1 T1 PREL 1 T2 PREL 1 Gaited one 1 1 F1 PREL 1 V1 PREL 1 The sample XML above shows the definition of the \"Icelandic Combination\" , a ranking that combines a t\u00f6lt score from either T1 or T2 , and the result of a gaited test ( F1 or V1 ) . The file could of course contain definitions for several Derived Results as well as other local competition data like custom tests . Let 's take a look at the different parts: ### Header section The header section of the XML needs three tags on the root level : | Tag | Description | Example | | --- | ----------- | ------- | | ` < source > ` | Must be ** LOCAL ** in user - defined XML files . Required . | _ & lt ; source & gt ; LOCAL & lt ; / source & gt ; _ | | ` < year > ` | The year of the competition .

Required . | _ & lt ; revision & gt ; 1 & lt ; / revision & gt ; _ | ### &lt;derived\\_results&gt; section The ` < derived_results > ` section of the file contains one or more definitions . Each definition resides in opening and closing ` < derived_result > ` tags . The following tags are valid inside a ` < derived_result > ` section : | Tag | Description | Example | | --- | ----------- | ------- | | ` < resultcode > ` | The short code of the Derived Result , used like a test code ( T1 , F1 , etc . ) .
